LEVEL EDITOR:
-------------
The tool used for creating the levels is called LevelEditor3D.exe

I created it as an aide for this specific game/engine in Construct Classic (free/open source)

THIS TOOL IS FOR WINDOWS ONLY, REQUIRES DIRECT-X 9 CAPABLE HARDWARE

Basic controls:
Arrow keys - Scroll
Right click - Select object
Left click - Drag object

S - Hide selected object (to allow working in 3D)
A - Show all objects (or re-load map for same effect)

Middle mouse button - Show a "rough" 3D representation of depth

Right Shift (hold) - Force object to avoid overlapping (might be broken)

Other controls are described in the program.
Defining variables for objects is done from a "command-line"-like system

Once a level has been created, make sure to save it to a new file (eg: level2.txt) and add update the file LevelList3D.txt

Only the first level in the list will be loaded and played in this game, but the engine supports multiple levels if you edit it :)

Otherwise, trial and error! Not much more support will be given for this tool itself since it was made in a rush for my project
